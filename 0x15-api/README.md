| To the browser, also known as the client, Facebook’s server is an API. This means that every time you visit a page on the Web, 
| you interact with some remote server’s API.
| An API isn’t the same as the remote server — rather it is the part of the server that receives requests and sends responses.
| It’s not uncommon for development teams to break up their application into multiple servers that talk to each other via APIs. 
| The servers that perform helper functions for the main application server are commonly referred to as microservices.
